Hello, me again. A few days ago I asked a question about installing Windows 7 on Coffee Lake. After successfully doing that, I've come to ask about another issue that comes up. Every single time I boot to my Windows 7 drive, it disk checks. After that, if I boot to 10, it "scans and repairs" the drive. Is the Windows 7 disk check confusing or damaging Windows 10? The Windows 10 disk repair is repairing the Windows 10 drive. I'm writing this as it repairs my drive. Last time I had a dual-boot.

I have a Toshiba Satellite C55t laptop that is not booting to Windows. When you power it on, it displays the Toshiba logo, then after a few minutes it blue screens and says that startup repairs need to be run. I have a Windows 10 repair disk. I set the boot priority to boot to the optical drive first. When the laptop is powered on, I can hear/feel the disk spinning, but it never boots into it. I've tried reseating the CMOS battery and am still not able to boot into anything. Нестабильные сектора или бэд блоки — это участки жесткого диска, чтение которых вызывает у контроллера затруднения. Hello there. my laptop is running fine at the moment, but I'm getting some strange issues and today it seems to have gotten worse. I was wondering if someone could help me out, or redirect me somewhere. All the research I've done on it suggests people deleting profiles, but that's not my case at all. I only have one profile on the laptop, and I'm the administrator. The laptop is running Windows 10, usually on the most recent update. It is an Aspire E5-575G. I purchased in in January 2017.

I tried unplugging both my HDDs and booting from a windows 8.1 DVD (can't find my windows 10 install media) but I've had no luck, and get the same BSOD each time with an error. Добрый день. На компьютере установлена операционная система Windows XP. На первом этапе появлялся черный экран. Imgur (https://i.imgur.com/4SfBzmg.jpg) Hello /r/techsupport! So my mom had some problems with her laptop and asked me to try to fix it after she tried for a few days (because I'm a good son). I think I've already figured out what's wrong, so that's a start! She was trying to do the new update to windows 10 on a 6 year old laptop, and believed that to be the problem when the computer stopped booting up. I believe the update used a section of the partition that was corrupted or corrupted. Восстановление системы после сбоев. Современные операционные системы довольно устойчивы к сбоям и, как правило, стабильность системы тем. 
So in my attempt to move the OS from HDD to SSD, I needed to resize the partition containing the OS on the HDD. I did this using MiniTool and resized a ~850 GB partition down to about 80 GB. MiniTool seemed to finish resizing the partition just fine until Windows said it was "preparing automatic repairs" on the following screen. It did this for about 20 hours before I tried a hard reset. A few resets later Windows seemed to progress to actually repairing the disk, but eventually Новая флеш-память 3D NAND от Intel и Micron 2015-04-15 15:44:04 По официальным данным в этой памяти плотность упаковки данных превышает в три раза возможности технологий. Hey there, whenever the battery dies in my Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series laptop it is no longer able to boot. I can fix this by making a windows 10 repair disk and running startup repair. It seems to not be a permanent problem and most data isn't lost, but it's still incredibly inconvenient. What could be the cause of this problem. I recently installed a program meant to change the login background for Windows 10. The program notified me that doing so could mess up my OS (which I clearly ignored), so I went ahead and tried to change the login picture. Upon trying to unlock my computer, the computer flashed my lock screen and a solid blue color, preventing me from getting in. Attempts at booting a Windows 10 repair disk from a USB have resulted in error messages that my drive is locked. Any ideas? EDIT: I managed My friend needs help repairing his laptop. It's a problem with disk for sure. He was doing normal stuff aka browsing the web when his computer froze. He restarted it and was greeted with a message that a required device is unplugged. error code 0x0000185. google search revealed that it's a problem with disk or MBR. Also booting takes forever and the screen turns off and on with a black screen when booting. He had an option to press enter and reboot Press F8 to enter boot options which. 
Last night I turned my PC off before bed and the next morning the first thing I did was turn it back on. I noticed it was taking forever and the windows icon popped up and at the bottom it said "repairing disk may take up to and hour" and then it told me the disk cannot be repaired and now it's stuck in this cycle. Every time I turn it on it fails to repair the disk and won't let me boot windows. Any suggestions. I accidentally set the active partition on my PC to the wrong thing so now whenever I try to boot it it just says "bootmgr is not loaded". I don't have the windows 7 installation disk all I have is a windows 10 laptop. My PC wasn't showing any display so I recently replaced my GPU, now there is an error (probably had something to do with the original video card that died) saying "boot selection failed 0xc00000f the boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible." Now I do happen to have Windows 10 loaded on a USB stick, so I did boot from there hoping to see a Repair option as I googled this error message. However Windows runs perfectly fine (all my same settings, no changes besides having. My computer has the "you pc needs to be repaired" with the error code code 0xc0000185 and cannot boot, only goes to grey screen and the error screen. I need a system repair disk, but i didnt make one beforehand. It is a asus i3 laptop, not sure what model sorry. Let's say I have a brand computer, Dell, HP, whatever, and I use Windows 8 or 10's program to create a recovery usb with an 8GB+ flash drive, as it requires for a full reinstallation. When I reinstall the OS with that flash drive onto a blank hard drive, will it recreate the system partition or just install the OS? I've done this before with a computer I no longer have access to, but I never checked if it recreated the partition, and I can't find a clear answer anywhere. Edit: Sorry, I should. 
My second hard drive (not my boot drive) is a 2 TB hard drive (non SSD). When I tried to open anything on this drive (D drive) it would notify me that the drive was not accessible as it was corrupted or unreadable. This had happened before, I ran error checking on the drive's properties menu, repaired the disk and it worked again. This time, I did the same thing, however after the restart, almost every folder on the drive is gone. It still says that the same amount Hi guys, thanks in advance for the help. I have a custom built desktop with Windows 10. Today when I tried to boot it, it couldn't get past the loading screen (Windows 10 Logo + spinning dots). I created a bootable windows 10 disk on a USB drive and have been trying to boot into it to try and repair the startup, but the disk won't load. It gets stuck on some sort of hybrid of my motherboard's BIOS startup screen and the windows loading dots. Photo My computer has the "you pc needs to be repaired" with the error code code 0xc0000185. It is a asus i3 laptop, not sure what model sorry. 
Here's my issue. I was using my desktop as normal, boom, randomly everything happens to shutdown. For awhile NOTHING but the computer would turn on, but I couldn't turn it off/restart it using the power buttons. Only way was to turn the psu switch off. A couple weeks later (current date), i can turn the computer on but it tells me that my system32 is corrupt. I've seen about 4-5 different errors and they all start with: WINDOWS/SYSTEM32/(insert problem here) Now, here's what I've tried:. I had upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1, and it was sitting on its own HDD. My desktop also had Windows 7 and Ubuntu on a second HDD, and in lieu of using GRUB on the second drive's MBR, I was using the Windows 7 boot loader to chainload Ubuntu (GRUB is installed to the partition Ubuntu is installed in). I alternated between both disks with the motherboard boot menu, because I didn't feel confident messing around with the Windows 10 boot settings yet (my system is not UEFI, BTW). Yesterda. I've been using Windows 10 for about 8 months now and actually quite satisfied with the performance. I never experienced any crashing, blue screen, etc. And then yesterday I was just casually watching a movie and it abruptly showed a "disk error" message and it restarted itself. The only new program I installed was Resident Evil 7 downloaded via Steam. Afterwards it took way longer to boot up the system and even then all the icons of the programs I pinned to the taskbar were missing (when 
Hi everyone! My laptop, running windows 10 showed a blue screen as soon as it booted, saying something along the lines of "your C: drive has errors, we'll repair them. Please wait." It kept doing that for about an hour, and then booted normally. When i'm about to check a folder i've been working on, i notice all of the folder's contents (multiple files and subfolders) are missing. Can't find them in the waste bin, tried searching for their names, no luck either. I'm currently looking Hi everyone!
